Technical Documentation Outline:

This document should include the following sections:
* Where the code is hosted

* Languages and technologies

Functions
Functions are an important step toward modularity because they are formalized methods of repetition. If there is a task that needs to be done again and again in your program, you can group the code into a function and call the function as often as you need it. This way, you only have to write the code once, but you can use it as often as you like.
Function is a named sequence of statements that belong together. Their primary purpose is to help us organize programs into chunks that match how we think about the solution to the problem.

Here is an example of a simple function:
def playagain():
    answer = input("Play again? yes or no \n")
    if answer == "yes":
        print ("OK")

* System requirements and supported applications

Enthought Python Minimum Hardware Requirements

* Audio and Video 
* Game app development
* System administration 
* Machine learning
* Business application 


* Coding/naming conventions

Naming conventions are very important and useful in any programming language. Here we will see various Python naming conventions that we should use while programming in Python.

There are certain rules we need to follow while naming a function in Python.
* Rule-1: We should write the Python function name with all lower case characters.
* Rule-2: Do not use uppercase character while naming a function in python.
* Rule-3: Use underscore(_) in between the words instead of space while naming a function.

Example:
def my_function(): print("This is the way we should use the function name") def critical_function(): print("Better function name") def new_data(): print("Better function name")




* How to run/build/deploy the program

You can get the code for the example from the Fly-Examples Github repository. Just git clone https://github.com/fly-apps/python-hellofly-flask to get a local copy.
The Python hellofly application is, as you'd expect for an example, small. It's a Python application that uses the Flask web framework. Here's all the code form hellofly.py:


* An overview of the architecture

Python is an object-oriented programming language like Java. Python is called an interpreted language. Python uses code modules that are interchangeable instead of a single long list of instructions that was standard for functional programming languages. The standard implementation of python is called “cpython”.
